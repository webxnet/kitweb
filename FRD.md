# Functional Requirements Document (FRD)

## 1. Introduction
- **Purpose:**
  - The purpose of this document is to outline the functional requirements for the development of an API Backend in NestJS with Prisma ORM.
- **Scope:**
  - This document covers the functionalities and features expected from the API Backend, including user authentication, data management, and system interactions.

## 2. Background
- **Context:**
  - The API Backend is designed to support a web application that requires secure user authentication, role-based access control, and efficient data management through Prisma ORM.

## 3. Scope and Objectives
- **Scope:**
  - The API Backend will handle user registration, authentication, and authorization.
  - CRUD operations for user data will be managed through Prisma ORM.
- **Objectives:**
  - Provide a secure and scalable backend for the associated web application.
  - Enable efficient data retrieval and storage using Prisma ORM.

## 4. Functionalities
- **User Authentication:**
  - Users can register with a unique username and a secure password.
  - Registered users can log in using their credentials.
  - Password recovery functionality is available.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - The system supports multiple roles (e.g., admin, user).
  - Administrators can assign roles to users.

- **Token Management:**
  - JWT Tokens are used for user authentication.
  - Tokens have a limited lifespan for security.

- **User Management:**
  - Users can view and edit their profile information.
  - CRUD operations for user accounts are managed through Prisma ORM.

- **Security:**
  - User passwords are securely hashed before storage.
  - All data transmission is encrypted using HTTPS.

## 5. User Roles and Responsibilities
- **User Roles:**
  - Admin
  - User
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Admins can manage user roles and access control.
  - Users can access their profiles and perform relevant operations.

## 6. Data Requirements
- **Data Inputs:**
  - User registration data.
  - User login credentials.
- **Data Outputs:**
  - JWT tokens upon successful authentication.
  - User profile information.

## 7. System Interfaces
- **Prisma ORM:**
  - Integration with Prisma ORM for efficient database access.
- **External Services:**
  - Potential integration points with external authentication services.

## 8. Non-functional Requirements
- **Performance:**
  - API endpoints respond within 200ms under normal load.
- **Reliability:**
  - The API is available 99.9% of the time.
- **Security:**
  - Compliance with industry-standard security practices.

## 9. Documentation
- **API Documentation:**
  - Comprehensive documentation for API endpoints.
- **Code Comments:**
  - Clear and concise comments in the codebase.

## 10. Monitoring and Logging
- **Monitoring:**
  - Performance and error monitoring using appropriate tools.
- **Logging:**
  - Generation of logs for critical events and errors.

## 11. Assumptions and Dependencies
- **Assumptions:**
  - The web application will handle user interface aspects.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Relies on Prisma ORM for database interactions.

## 12. Constraints
- **Budget:**
  - Budget constraints for the development and deployment phases.
- **Timeline:**
  - Project completion within a specified timeframe.

## 13. Acceptance Criteria
- **User Registration:**
  - Users can successfully register with unique credentials.
- **User Authentication:**
  - Users can log in and receive valid JWT tokens.

## 14. Change Control Procedures
- **Change Request Process:**
  - Any changes to the requirements must be submitted through a formal change request.
  - Changes will be reviewed and approved by the project management team.
